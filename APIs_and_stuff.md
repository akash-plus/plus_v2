This is the login/signup page and would use otpless or mobile authentication.

A first time user either taps on the whatsapp button or mobile login.

If whatsapp, then the user is directed to a webpage and then from there to an otpless
contact on whatsapp for sending a message which then authenticates the user and also
provides a waID which when used with the clientID and clientSecret gives User Name and Mobile Number.

If user straightup wants to signup with the mobile number then the user is asked for their mobile number and sent an OTP for verification.
